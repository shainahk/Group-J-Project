# Project Proposal
## Title: Predicting US Used Vehicle Prices Based on the Vehicle Make, Body and Mileage

## Problem Statement

Prospective used car buyers with a lack of knowledge on the effect of a vehicleâ€™s mileage, make and body on its value are highly likely to be overcharged at dealerships. Making this information available will help prospective buyers make more informed decisions and reduce the chances of buyers paying significantly more than market value for a particular used vehicle.

## Proposed Solutions
### 1. Multiple Regression Model

  Create a Multiple Regression model using scikit-learn in Python to predict the selling price of a vehicle based on make, body and mileage. Scikit-learn is an open source data analysis library that includes key    concepts such as classification, regression, and clustering. 

### 3. Relationship Between Condition and Mileage and Estimated Price
  
  Demonstrate the relation of condition and mileage, and estimated price.

### 4. Statistics By State
  
  Determine the standard deviation between estimated price and selling price for each state.
  
  Determine which dealership has the best prices in each state.

## Data Source

### Source: 
Kaggle

### Dataset: 
Vehicle Sales Data

### Description: 
This data set provides a collection of information pertaining to the sales transactions of various vehicles. This data set encompasses details such as make, model, year, trim, body type, transmission, ID number, condition rating, odometer reading, seller information, market value and selling price.

## Expected Outcomes & Deliverables

A Dashboard displaying the results of Possible Solutions 2 and 3. This dashboard should include a changeable variable to switch US states where the prices for each make of vehicle will be shown.

Multiple Regression Model resulting from Possible Solution 1.
